 * 
 * @Description Write a program that asks for the speed of a vehicle
 * (in miles per hour) and the number of hours it has traveled. It 
 * should use a loop to display the distance a vehicle has traveled 
 * for each hour of a time period specified by the user. Do not accept
 * a negative number for speed and do not accept any value less than 1
 * for time traveled.
