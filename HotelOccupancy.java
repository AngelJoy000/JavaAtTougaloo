 * 
 * @Description Write a program that calculates the occupancy rate for each 
 * floor of a hotel. The program should start by asking for the number of floors
 * in the hotel. A loop should then iterate once for each floor. During each iteration,
 * the loop should ask the user for the number of rooms on the floor and the number of 
 * them that are occupied. After all the iterations, the program should display the number
 * of rooms the hotel has, the number of them that are occupied, the number that are vacant,
 * and the occupancy rate for the hotel. Do not accept a value less than one for the number
 * of floors. Do not accept a number less than 10 for the number of rooms on a floor.
