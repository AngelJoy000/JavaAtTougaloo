# javaSolutions

This repository contains my solutions to various Java related problems that I find in text books. The current set contains solutions to challenges found in the text "Starting Out with Java: From Control Structures through Objects (5th Edition)" by Tony Gaddis and "Data Structures and Algorithms in Java" by Robert Lafore. The former whose book itself does not contain answers to any of the problems which I believe to be a good thing as I would have found myself peeking more than once.

# Objective

The goal of this repository is document my progress through both textbooks and their challenges to better understand general programming concepts.
